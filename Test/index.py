    #The errors in the code:

#The only issue with previous code was that you were comparing a string to an integer, which would raise a TypeError. By converting question_no to an integer, as you did in the updated code, you resolved this issue and your code now works as expected.

#In Python, a TypeError occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. In your code, the TypeError occurred because the input() function always returns a string, and you cannot compare a string to an integer using the > operator.

#Here's what happened in your code:

#Initially, question_no was an integer, initialized to 1.
# When you used the input() function to get user input, the value entered by the user was always a string.
# You tried to compare the user input (a string) to question_no (an integer) using the > operator, which caused the TypeError.
# To fix this issue, you need to convert the user input from a string to an integer before you can compare it to question_no. You can do this using the int() function, like this:

# user_input = input("Enter your answer (1-4) or type 'exit' to quit: ")
# if user_input == "exit":
#     print("Goodbye!")
#     sys.exit()
# else:
#     user_answer = int(user_input)
#     if user_answer > question_no:
        # do something
    # else:
        # do something else
        
#By converting the user input to an integer using int(), you can compare it to the integer value of question_no using the > operator without causing a TypeError.
